Overall, this was a great learning exercise for me.  I often talk about not knowing what I don't know and this collection did a great job of demonstrating where I should be putting effort and where I'm coming along in my developer training.  I'm strongest in Ruby and have been focusing effort recently on my testing there, so that's what should be the most solid. Javascript and it's associated libraries are going to be my next area of effort.  Right now I can get things done, but it's neither as fast, nor as pretty as I would prefer.

I welcome all feedback, thanks for picking interesting examples!
